#  Predbat Home Assistant Add-on (Docker)
Predbat Home Assistant Add-on

This add-on can be used with Home Assistant to run Predbat without AppDaemon

The code here can also be used to run Predbat outside Home Assistant (but still talking to Home Assistant)

See the documentation https://github.com/springfall2008/predbat_addon/blob/main/predbat/DOCS.md
